## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that

- you are a system administrator that can create external client apps in Salesforce
- you have read Salesforce's [OAuth 2.0 Web Server Flow for Web App Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_web_server_flow.htm)

## Creating an External Client App

<Steps>
<Step> 
  In your Salesforce home page, click the settings icon (⚙️) at the top right corner and select `Setup`
</Step>

<Step>
  In the left sidebar, search for `External Client App Manager`. It should be
  under `Platform Tools` -> `Apps` -> `External CLient Apps`. Click this menu
  item.
</Step>

<Step>
  In the left sidebar, search for `External Client App Manager`. It should be
  under `Platform Tools` -> `Apps` -> `External CLient Apps`. Click this menu
  item.
</Step>

<Step>
  Click the `New External Client App` button at the top right corner and fill in
  all required fields from the `Basic Information` section.
</Step>

<Step>
  We will configure OAuth in the next section of this guide. For now, click
  `Create`.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Salesforce OAuth Configuration

### Policies Tab

You may optionally edit the `Policies` tab with custom `Oauth Start URL`, guest users, refresh
token policy, and so on.

However, the main option to note is `App Authorization` -> `IP Relaxation`, which you may need top
modify to allow logins from IP addresses not configured by your organisations, if this is your
use case.

If unsure, keep all settings in this tab the same as the default.

### Settings Tab

This is the second tab within `Policies`, `Settings`, `Package Defaults`.

<Steps>
  <Step>Once you are in the `Settings` tab , click `Edit`</Step>
  <Step>
    Under the `OAuth Settings` accordion, tick the `Enable OAuth` checkbox
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under `App Settings` -> `Callback URL`, enter your better-auth callback.
    For example,

    ```text
    http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/salesforce
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under `OAuth Scopes`, ensure that at minimum, the following are present:
    
    1. Access the identity of URL service (id, profile, email, address, phone)
    2. Access unique user identifiers (openid)

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under `Flow Enablement`, tick the options
    <Callout>
    Note: the second option will only apear after ticking the first option.
    </Callout>

    1. Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow
    1. Require user credentials in the POST body for Authorization Code and Credentials Flow

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Under `Security`, you can keep the defaults, which has the following enabled:

    1. Require secret for Web Server Flow
    1. Require secret for Refresh Token Flow
    1. Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click `Save`, then scroll back up to `Oauth Settings` -> `App Settings`. There
    should now be a button for `Consumer Key and Secret` that you can click on.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy your `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`, which will be used as environment
    variables `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID` and `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively.
  </Step>

  </Steps>
  
## Usage with Better Auth

<Steps>

<Step>

### Configure the provider

To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    salesforce: {
      clientId: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID as string, // Consumer Key [!code highlight]
      clientSecret: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // Consumer Secret [!code highlight]

      /*
       * The default is https://login.salesforce.com for Production.
       * If you are using a Sandbox Org, you can instead specify
       * - https://test.salesforce.com
       */
      instanceUrl: "https://test.salesforce.com",

      /*
       * This option (default true) corresponds with Salesforce OAuth Security option:
       * - Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows
       *
       * If you disable pkce, you will also need to modify your External Client App.
       */
      pkce: true,
    },
  },
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Sign In with Salesforce

To sign in with Salesforce, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client.
You will need to specify `salesforce` as the provider.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
const authClient = createAuthClient();

const signIn = async () => {
  const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "salesforce", // [!code highlight]
  });
};
```

</Step>

</Steps>
